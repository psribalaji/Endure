# electron-prebuilt-quick-start

**Clone and run for a quick way to see electron-prebuilt in action.**

This is a minimal electron-prebuilt application based on the [Quick Start Guide](http://electron-prebuilt.atom.io/docs/tutorial/quick-start) within the electron-prebuilt documentation.

**Use this app along with the [electron-prebuilt API Demos](http://electron-prebuilt.atom.io/#get-started) app for API code examples to help you get started.**

A basic electron-prebuilt application needs just these files:

- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
- `main.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's **main process**.
- `index.html` - A web page to render. This is the app's **renderer process**.

You can learn more about each of these components within the [Quick Start Guide](http://electron-prebuilt.atom.io/docs/tutorial/quick-start).
